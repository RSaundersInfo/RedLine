Do you have trouble reading documents on the screen?  Do you like to use a ruler when reading a book?  

This program creates a floating line to assist with reading documents on the screen.  Settings are adjustable from the system tray icon.

V1.5 updated settings ranges to allow for vertical line.

Installer in RedLine\Setup folder.
